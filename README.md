# merge_sort-algorithm-using-python
We already learnt the divide and conquer strategy and how to use recursive function to intuitively
resolve some issues.
Here, you have to implement an important sorting algorithm “Merge Sort”.
We describe the algorithm of “merge sort” and your task is to implement the algorithm using Python.
“Merge sort is a recursive algorithm that continually splits a list in half. If the list is empty or has one
item, it is sorted by definition (the base case). If the list has more than one item, we split and recursively
invoke a merge sort on both halves. Once the two halves are sorted, the fundamental operation, called
merge, is performed. Merging is the process of taking two smaller sorted lists and combining them
together into a single, sorted, new list.
• Splitting the List in a Merge Sort
• Lists as They Are Merged Together
